An example implementation of a metric analyzer which can reused. Few trivial operations are shown to demonstrate but users can define their custom operation in metric class. 
Users can create new metrics in the constructor of the metric analyzer and then connect to an uvm analysis port receive the transactions. The write method can then measure different metrics from the transactions.
